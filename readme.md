## Project Name: snowflakelite

snowflakelite is a distributed ID generation scheme based on the Snowflake algorithm, optimized for the limitations of the traditional Snowflake algorithm in clock rollback scenarios, solving the ID conflict problem caused by time rollback. It has no additional storage dependencies such as MySQL, zookeeper, etc., and is ready to use out of the box.

### No need to worry about clock rollback at runtime & longer storage lifespan
By introducing the design of a time window, snowflakelite can tolerate clock rollback within a certain range, ensuring that the generated IDs remain globally unique even under extreme conditions, without the need for additional clock calibration logic. The usage strategy of the timestamp field has been optimized to support a longer time span.

### Compatibility and Ease of Use
In the implementation process, snowflakelite maintains interface compatibility with the existing Snowflake algorithm (up to 64-bit ID), while providing higher stability and fault tolerance, suitable for distributed architectures of different scales.
